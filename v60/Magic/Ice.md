# Basic Spells


**Chill** (Basic) `[T0❄️|🏹Short]`  
`[◆A]` Quickly chill something down to freezing temperatures. Freeze any exposed water (creating at most a block of ice/snow size ♟️=❄️)  
`[◆A]`Make a Ranged Attack, dealing `1(❄️)` Frost damage. If **❄>Will/Endure** target Staggers.

**Iceshape** (Basic) `[T1❄️|🏹Short]`  
`[◆A]` Freeze the air into ice and snow. Choose `T+1` effects to create nearby:  
• ***Slick Ground*** Hazard: ♠Aware/Survival or Knock Down  
• ***Ice spikes*** Hazard: deals `1d6` +Pierce, then shatters   
• ***Snowbank*** Obstacle: grant Cover to nearby allies  
• ***Icicle Spear*** Weapon: `[♣♠|Melee|❄️(3)|Keen;Fragile]`

**Frostwind** (Basic) `[T2❄️|🏹Short]`  
`[◆A]` A Blast of extreme cold deals `T+1d6(T)` damage in an area *(Resist:Endure/Will)*, `+T` extra damage if there is only one target. Targets that are Injured or take 3+ damage are coated in frost, affecting them based on ♟Size.
• `♟4` Large targets **Stagger** *(Lose a ◇Minor)*  
• `♟3` Medium targets are **Frostbitten**. They are Slow *(lose ◇Minor/↻React each round)*, take +1 Frost damage, and can use `◆Action` to roll **♠♥Endure/Will vs Tier** to shrug the effect off. Targets that are already Frostbitten are instead Frozen.  
• `♟2` Small targets are **Frozen**, unable to act or recover 💟Health. Once per round, targets can spend an ◆Action to roll **♣♠Will/Endure vs Tier** to break free, but take 1d6 Frost Damage with each failure.

**Sleetstorm** (Basic) `[T3❄️|🏹Long|🧠Focus]`  
`[◆◇A+]`*(Incomplete; Create massive area of Difficult Terrain, poor visibility, and repeated Blunt/Frost damage, possibly with recurring Initiative effects)*

> **Frost Damage** extinguishes targets who are On Fire, as are small sources of fire (candles, lanterns, etc). Frozen Winds typically deal Frost Damage, but Ice itself typically deals Pierce or Blunt damage.     
> **Creating Ice** relies on water in the environment. In areas with little or no humidity (such as deserts, droughts, or large fires), casters may need to provide their own water.  

> **Stagger :** Target loses a ◇Minor Action from their next turn. Targets with no ◇Minor Actions remaining are Stunned.  
> **Pierce :** Each point of 🛡Armor blocks 1 less damage  
> **Slow :** Each round, target gains one less ◇Minor and ↻Reaction  
> **Frozen :** Target is completely unable to act, and can't recover 💟Health. Target is protected from outside damage, though 4+ Blunt, Crush, or Fire damage can break a target free.
