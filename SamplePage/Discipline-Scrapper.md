# Scrapper

Scrappers are rough-and-tumble brawlers, people who are more likely to have learned to fight in bars and back alleys than through disciplined militia training. In a fight, Scrappers are less likely to use expensive and carefully maintained weapons. Instead, they throw chairs, break bottles, and chuck people through windows.

Scrappers can focus on **Improvising** and **Brawling**

### **Tips**

- Most scrappers benefit from **â™£Body**, **Athletics**, and **Aim**, which help them make the most of **Brawling** and **Thrown Weapons** (which, once thrown, can be picked up from the area they were thrown into).

- **Improvisers** benefit most from **â™£Body** (as so few improvised weapons are graceful). **Fight** helps to hit with the weapons, but after taking **Improvised Arms** you can instead rely on **Athletics**

- **Brawlers** rely on **â™£â™ Athletics** for their Brawling Attacks, and are less effective against larger targets. They  excel at subduing targets smaller or weaker than themselves, but must be careful about subjecting themselves to too many **â†»Free Attacks** from Guarding enemies when entering Close Quarters.

- Scrappers love getting into fights in small spaces with lots of **Obstacles** and **Cover**, such as shops, houses, bars, or even forests. If a map is unclear, make sure to ask your GM what sort of objects are in an area that you might be able to improvise into weapons

## Improvised Weapons

- **Improvised Arms** `[Trait]`    
  In your hands, **Fragile** and **Improvised** weapons deal at least **3 Base Damage**, are not **Unwieldy**, and count as **Athletic** *(you can make Melee Attacks with either Fight or Athletics)*. When a weapon is broken by an attack, if your opponent has less **â™£Body** than you, they **Stagger** *(target loses a Minor Action)*
- **Improvised Strike** `[â—‡Minor Action]`  
  As a Minor Action, grab a nearby object or weapon and **Attack** with it. *The object must be open in the environment, not on your person. Grabbing the object counts as Movement*
- **Improvised Block** `[â†»Reaction]`   
  While **Guarding**, you can use a held object as an improvised **Shield**. It blocks damage equal to your `â™£Body` (`+1` if the object is held in two hands). If the object is Fragile, or if  you take damage from the attack, the object is **Damaged**.
- **Splinter Strike** `[â—†Action]`   
  Make an Attack that deals **+1(1) Damage** and is **Keen** *(Crits on a 5 or 6)*. On Crit, your weapon is Damaged. If your weapon breaks, your target rolls `[â™£â™ Endure/Will] vs T1(9)` or becomes **Stunned**. *(If Unarmed, you instead take 3 Damage on Crit, and Stun if this Injures you)*
- **Throw Anything** `[Trait]`   
  Any weapon or object you can lift can be Thrown at Short Range (as though it had the **Throw** feature). If the object could already be **Thrown**, its Ranged is increased *(Short ðŸ¡¢ Medium ðŸ¡¢ Long ðŸ¡¢ Extreme)*

## Brawling

- **Brutal Brawl** `[Trait]`   
  When you succeed at a **Brawl** Attack *(such as Grab, Push, Knock Down, etc)*, you may also deal damage from an Unarmed Attack. *For most Medium characters, Unarmed Attacks deal 2(2) Damage.*
- **Fluid Brawl** `[â—‡Minor Action]`    
  As a Minor Action, make a **Brawl** Attack *(Grab, Push, or Knock Down)*
- **Hurl** `[â—†Action]`   
  When you have a target Grabbed, you can attempt to throw them into one or more nearby targets. Make a single **Brawl** Attack, opposed by both the grabbed enemy and any targets. If you best all targets, they each take Collision Damage equal to the thrown character's **â™ŸSize** (3 for Medium characters). Targets who take damage from this are **Knocked Down**. If you fail, the thrown enemy is safely caught and no longer Grabbed.
- **Tackle** `[â—†Action / â†»Reaction]`   
  As one Action, you can Move into **Close Quarters** with a nearby target and attempt to Knock them Down (as a **Brawl** Attack). Whether you succeed or not, you are also **Knocked Down**. While **Guarding**, you can also use this as a **â†»Free Attack** when a target Moves (as though making a Melee Attack)
- **Hostage Block** `[â†»Reaction]`   
  While you have an enemy Grabbed, you can attempt to use them as a Shield, blocking damage equal to your `[Athletics]` (the enemy takes that damage instead). If you are in Close Quarters with a target you have not grabbed (or who has grabbed you), you can make a **Brawl** roll against the target - if successful, you use them as a shield anyway.

### About Improvised Weapons

An Improvised Weapon is an object that was not made with the intent of acting as a weapon. The GM can rule that the weapon is similar to an existing weapon and give it those stats, but it will typically deal `1(1)` less damage, count as **Fragile** or **Unwieldy**.

**Fragile** Objects are Damaged when they **Crit** (roll '6' when Attacking), and are usually destroyed or rendered unusable. For improvised weapons, the GM rules whether a Damaged Object is totally unusable, has changed shape, or must be damaged again before breaking.

**Unwieldy** Objects attack with Disadvantage.

Here are some sample stats for common improvised weapons

- **Bottle** â€” *Close Weapon* â€“ **2(3)** â€“ Fragile; Thrown 
  - **Broken Bottle** â€” *Close Weapon* â€“ **3(3)** â€“ Fragile; Bleed
- **Small Heavy Object** â€” *Mixed Weapon* â€” 2(2) â€” Athletic; Thrown
- **Table Leg, Branch, Improvised Club** â€” *Melee Weapon* â€“ **2(â™£)** â€“ Fragile; Stagger
- **Chair, Wheel, Small Furniture** â€” *2H Mixed Weapon* â€“ **3(â™£)** â€“ Unwieldy; Control
- **Large Cumbersome Object** â€” *2H Close Weapon* â€“ **4(â™£)** â€“ Unwieldy; Fragile
- **Table, Log, Ladder, Shelf, Bench**  â€” *2H Reach Weapon* â€“ **3(â™£)** â€“ Unwieldy; Massive; Sweep
