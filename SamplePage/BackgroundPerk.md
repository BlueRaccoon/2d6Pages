# Background Perks

Each new character can start with one of the following Background Perks, reflecting their lives up to this point.

*Each perk has choices and ways to customize to your character. Make any applicable choices and note them down. Discuss the details with your GM, making sure your background makes sense within the world and that you'll have some access to it during the game.*



## Bond : `(Ally)`
Your character begins the game with a companion. Your companion is loyal and willing to listen to you, and you can understand eachother (even if otherwise impossible).
*Decide on what type of ally you have, how you met, and why they are loyal to you. With GM guidance, choose your companion or build them like a character*
- For your companion, you can make a Human or Animate with basic skills and a Discipline, or you can choose a Tier-0 creature
- Your companion's highest Skill is always 1 less than your highest skill. They increase in Attributes along with you. Player-like companions can train in techniques and spells normally, and creature companions can attempt to learn more techniques used by similar creatures (with GM approval)

## Connections : `(Organization)`
You are well-connected and have a place of status and respect within an area or organization. You can call upon your contacts for aid and support, and they may sometimes call upon you as well.   
*Choose an organization or location for your connections. You might choose a larger organization established in the GM's world, or one of smaller scope you develop yourself. Decide if you are an active member, a former member, or if you simply have many contacts. You can also choose a specific area, such as a town, the district of a city, or a people.*
- Once per day, you can attempt to call in a favor from your contacts. You can attempt to request help, supplies, information, equipment, or services. Roll `♥♦Network` to determine the scope of aid you can get.
- Your contacts will also call on you for help. If you have recently failed or refused a request, your own requests are made with Disadvantage. If you came through in a big way, your next request can be made with Advantage.

## Heirloom : `(Item)`
Your character begins the game with a rare and personal item. The item is personally identifiable in some way, and it may have some magical or historical significance.
*Choose an Artifact or piece of equipment with Tier 2 or lower quality. Consider where it came from and what its significance might be.*
- Start with a T2 Artifact, Weapon, or other piece of equipment. If your character trades, sells, breaks, or loses the item, there may be some broader reprecussions.

## Hideout : `(Location | Features)`
Your character has some kind of hideout, residence, or base to call their own (or at least where they are always welcome). Your hideout is generally stable, self-sufficient, and reasonably stocked with basic supplies and provisions.    
*Work out with your GM where this base might be located, then choose 2 of the following features that apply to your base.*
- **Fortified :** Your base is secure; it is extremely difficult to assault, destroy, or infiltrate by normal means
- **Secret :** Your base's location is not common knowledge. It is difficult to find or gain entry without your help.
- **Warded :** Your base has abundant magical protections. It is well protected against external surveilance and magical entry.
- **Staffed :** Your base has a full staff of servants, guards, employees, allies, or people otherwise willing to help in its upkeep.
- **Luxury :** Your base is elegant, lavish, and upper-crust. It excels at hosting esteemed and high-status guests, or simply acting as a show of wealth and power.
- **Scattered :** Instead of a single base, you have many smaller, disconnected bases scattered across the continent. Wherever there is civilization, you likely have some kind of small foothold.

## Holdings
Your character has a wealthy family, a business, land, investments, or some other way to passively generate income. Your holdings are stable and self-sufficient, but you can dip into them on occasion for some extra money. Be wary that taking out too much money at once could cause your holdings to collapse.
- Once per week, you can dip into your Holdings (as long as you can somehow contact them) Roll `♦Finance` or `♥Network`, and gain Dime equal to 10 x Tier rolled.
- You can invest money back into your holdings; potentially increasing the amount of money generated.
- You can take money more than once per week. If you do, for every `1` rolled, something catastrophic happens to your holdings, requiring your immediate attention and possibly hurting the amount of money earned in future.

## Mentor : `(Name | Discipline)`
Your character has a long-time mentor who is willing to train and advise you.   
*Decide on your mentor's name, and the Discipline they represent. Work with your GM to figure out where they live and how you normally access them.*
- You may begin the game having already **Trained** an available Technique or Spell Form from your mentor.
- During down time, your Mentor can train you in Techniques from their chosen Discipline. The training is intense, and you take **Strain** from doing so.

## Reputation : `(Deed | Type)`
Your character has developed a powerful reputation, and their name (or a pseudonym) is known far and wide, even outside of their normal circles.   
*Decide on what deed or event made your character famous. Work with your GM to determine how strangers are likely to view you, and how easily recognizable your name or face may be.*
- You may be Famous, Notorious, or just highly recognizable. Your name may inspire fear, awe, admiration, respect, or just recognition.
- When meeting a stranger (or arriving in a new location), you can try to drop your name to some benefit. Roll 1d6 and consult the chart below
  - `1-2` Some trouble is caused; maybe the person hates your reputation, maybe a terrible rumor has tarnished your name, or maybe fans and paparazi are a little too eager to see you.
  - `3-4` Your name may sound familiar, or even well known, but it doesn't carry enough weight here to change minds and move hearts
  - `5-6` You are regarded with some mix of respect, admiration, awe, and fear. People are more likely to help you, or at least to get out of your way.

### Vocation : `(Job)`
Your character has (or once had) a stable job, or some kind of special vocational training. If applicable, you may be recognized by members of your profession.  
*Choose a Job for your character and mark it down. Work with your Game Master to make sure that job is plausible in the world, and to work out how it has affected your life*
- Gain a **Specialty** related to your job
- Start with a set of tools, equipment, research, or personal connections related to your job (at most T1)
> "Specialties" act like +2 Skills that can be used in situations where you might not otherwise have a relevant skill.
>  For instance, a specialty in Cooking might be used to cook, to purchase cooking ingredients, to network with other chefs, or to show knowledge about food or cooking techniques.
