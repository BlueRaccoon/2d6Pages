### `[❂Benediction]` Hearts of Many
- **Hearts of Many** — `[❂Ben:T2]` (Support)
  - `[↻React]` Rally the support of allies. When an ally you can see makes a roll to accomplish a task, you may add **[T]** to that roll.
  - Friends of that ally may also lend their support. Any friend aware of the situation may also use their ↻Reactions, rolling `[♥Will|Presence|Empathy]` and adding their Tier to the roll. They take Strain by doing so.
  - Given 10|50|100|200 supporters (allies who are not personal friends, but believe in the target), the target can re-roll a die (these supporters also take Strain).
  - **[Enhanced]** You can cast this on a target you can't see, as long as you are aware of their struggle. Friends and Supporters can support this way as well.
  > You can cast this spell on yourself. If you do, you only gain benefits from friends and supporters (not from yourself)

### `[⚉Anima]` Support Staff
- **Support Staff** — `[⚉Ani:T2]` (Support)
  - `[◆Act]+Focus` Animate any number of objects in a large area (Medium or smaller objects) to assist with a specific type of task.
  - The animated objects can bring tools, clear the area, provide light/seating, help move or sort, or other simple untrained tasks. The objects take simple instructions from people you designate, and will readily help with most tasks. Up to **[T]** times each round, the objects can give Advantage to a related roll, as long as they could reasonably provide help.
  - **[Enhanced]** The spell no longer requires Focus, and can act as staff or support across a much larger area (a building, one level of a castle/dungeon, or similarly sized space)
  > The objects can't defend themselves, and can be easily dispersed. For every 3 damage taken by the objects, the Tier of the spell is reduced by 1 (Dispelling at T0). The objects are immune to Pain, Mental, and Poison. If the objects are Pushed or Knocked Down, they can't assist until next round.

### `[♜Channel]` Mimicry
- **Mimicry** `[♜Chn:T2]` (Support)
  - `[↻React]+Focus` Observe the motions of a target, mimicing their muscle memory. When you observe a target using a non-magical Skill or Technique, you attempt to temporarily learn it (as long as you maintain focus). Your motions will uncannily resemble the target's to any onlookers.
  - When observing a Skill, you can immitate that skill. You improve that skill to match the target's ability, increasing your skill by at most **[T+1]**
  - When observing a Technique, you can immitate it. When copying a stunt, you take Strain ~~If the technique consumes some special resource, you gain **[T]** of that resource~~
  - [Enhanced] You can copy a spell or magical ability of **[T]** or lower, using Channeling instead of the related school.

### `[🜛Illusion]` Double-Take
- **Double-Take** `[🜛Ill:T2]` (Support)
  - `[↻React]` Create a misleading illusion of an ally in a critical moment to confuse an enemy.
  - When an ally makes an Opposed Roll, you attempt to mask and misrepresent their movements, giving **Disadvantage** to their opponent. Enemies with **[Perception]** greater than **[T]** are unaffected.
  - The illusion can be made subtly, perceptible only to the affected enemy.

### `[⛯Scry]` Spotter
- **Spotter** `[⛯Scr:T2]` (Support)
  - `[↻React]` Share your awareness with a target, either making them aware of something in the environment or momentarily lending them your senses.
  - This effect can allow your target to add **[T]** to an Aim, Perception, or Survival roll. It can also be used to discreetly draw attention or share information about the environment.
  - The effect is subtle, and onlookers or even the affected target may be unaware of the spell.

### `[☯︎Spirit]` Give Hope
- **Give Hope** `[☯︎Spr:T2]` (Support)
  - `[◆Action]+Focus` Eminate an aura of hope an optimism, helping those nearby to see the best in a situation. While focusing, you can use your **[↻Reaction]** to do any of the following:
    - Any number of targets you see can use **[T]** in place of Will or Endure this round
    - If an ally would take Mental or Pain damage, they resist up to **[T]** of that damage
    - If an ally attempts to resist some effect using `Will|Endure`, they can add **[T]** to their roll
    - When attempting to persuade or influence a target, you can tempt them towards trusting or seeing the best in others. This can add up to  **[T]** to a relevant Charm roll.
