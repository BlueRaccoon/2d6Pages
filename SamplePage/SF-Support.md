### `[❂Benediction]` Hearts of Many
- **Hearts of Many** — `[❂Ben:T2]` (Support)
  - `[↻React]` Rally the support of allies. When an ally you can see makes a roll to accomplish a task, you may add **[T]** to that roll.
  - Friends of that ally may also lend their support. Any friend aware of the situation may also use their ↻Reactions, rolling `[♥Will|Presence|Empathy]` and adding their Tier to the roll. They take Strain by doing so.
  - Given 10|50|100|200 supporters (allies who are not personal friends, but believe in the target), the target can re-roll a die (these supporters also take Strain).
  - **[Enhanced]** You can cast this on a target you can't see, as long as you are aware of their struggle. Friends and Supporters can support this way as well.
  > You can cast this spell on yourself. If you do, you only gain benefits from friends and supporters (not from yourself)

### `[⚉Anima]` Support Staff
- **Support Staff** — `[⚉Ani:T2]` (Support)
  - `[◆Act]+Focus` Animate any number of objects in a large area (Medium or smaller objects) to assist with a specific type of task.
  - The animated objects can bring tools, clear the area, provide light/seating, help move or sort, or other simple untrained tasks. The objects take simple instructions from people you designate, and will readily help with most tasks. Up to **[T]** times each round, the objects can give Advantage to a related roll, as long as they could reasonably provide help.
  - **[Enhanced]** The spell no longer requires Focus, and can act as staff or support across a much larger area (a building, one level of a castle/dungeon, or similarly sized space)
  > The objects can't defend themselves, and can be easily dispersed. For every 3 damage taken by the objects, the Tier of the spell is reduced by 1 (Dispelling at T0). The objects are immune to Pain, Mental, and Poison. If the objects are Pushed or Knocked Down, they can't assist until next round.
  
  - `[♜Chn:T2]` **Mimicry** (Support)
